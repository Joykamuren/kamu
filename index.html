     <h3> Insights from the book</h3>
       <p>From the book BORN A CRIME by Trevor Noah,we can focus on the life of her mother Patricia. She faced many challenges throughout her life.She got a child from a white man in which thesociety culd not allow such kind of relationship to happen.People could see her a  prostute,but that was not the right way to conclude in such way.She also went through a lot when thry were coming from church at night where they could not get assitance because of her tribe.<br>Life is all about focusing and following your dreams never try to give up a long the way.Sometimes we can do thing which might hinder us from achieving our dreams.Take for instance Gmm went a head a tried out arbortion in which it lead to her death.The society is not giving all of it's members equal rights,If the society could allow the young girl's mistakes she could not haave lost her life due to unsafe arbortio.Same t the consititution of our country whereby they only permit abortion in certain curcumstances.Why could they not permit those people who want to conduct the act rather than the performing unsafe abortion? Many girls dreams are being hinder by small instances like unsafe activities.People are suffering in silence. Frankl's point of suffering is really showing how many people are beingprisoned by life.But he had hope wich finally made him t come out of the prison and that actually happened.So in every suffering there is success at the end end it is just the spirit f persistance and keping your dreams.From day to day why of life people see that most of the thing are impossible but that is not the fact.</p>

      <h4>Posive and negative impacts of colonasation</h4>
      <p>The colonialist came long years a go.They bring a lot of changes including both positive and negative.Introduction of Christianity which brought about more religious mission opportunities. For instance the missionaries intoduced education by establishing mission schools to educate the local people and to help them to learn more about their land and culture. This is still exists in the the land has helped almost everybody understands his or her own rights. <br> The Afracans also got a chance to learn the European language in which they still exist in all parts of the continent. Even in our country weare English speaker which emarged as a result of colonisation in our country<br> The Europeans were good people to Africans but the also had their own negatives as far as Africanism is concrned.They forced them to do eveything to be done by Africans just like them. Take an example of the people dressing just like them,I don't thing this so necessary to them. This actually erroded the African  culture. Also the issue of separation of the blacks and the whites was another thing wich was introduced  during colonisation error. The blacks where taken to reserves and this is still happening up to now. Racial discrimintion is still ann issues and this was introduced by the Europeans. This a regrassive move and I don't think this issue of disrimination will come to an end one day.</p>
